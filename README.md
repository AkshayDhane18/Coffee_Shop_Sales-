# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes sales data from a coffee shop to uncover insights into customer behavior and sales performance using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques. The goal is to identify trends and provide actionable recommendations for enhancing business strategies.

## Final Analysis

**Sales Consistency:**  
All coffee shop locations maintain similar sales patterns, reflecting consistent performance across the board.

Sales and order counts demonstrate stable trends over time, with a slight increase towards the end of each month. Daily sales are consistent throughout the week, peaking from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m., with moderate activity from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

**Product Preferences:**  
No distinct product category preferences are observed across the various stores, indicating steady demand for all product categories.

Trends indicate a positive growth trajectory with opportunities to enhance revenue through focused marketing and promotions. Addressing sales of higher-priced items can unlock additional growth potential.
